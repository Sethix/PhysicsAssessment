# Post-Mortem

I don't really know what to say. Everything kind of went wrong. It started with a good idea and a good work flow, but went to hell.

We had four weeks, but due to personal life stress, missing days because of work and having no motivation I ended up working for only two weeks. I had a much higher pile of work to clear than everyone else due to my knowledge of networking and being the only one that knew how to create a structure for all of us to use cleanly.

People got mad, people were disappointed and it over all just felt terrible. I'm disappointed in my self for not trying harder.

That being said, In the end, only one other person had a game to even present in front of the class. I'm glad we at least were the first to show and were ready in the end, even if it wasn't good.
